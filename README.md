source code of a website ,posh24.se/kandisar , storing it in a string and from there the name of celebs and their image links are
stored in two arraylists with the index corresponding to image and name.Using Random number from the list a random image is downloaded
and the name is put in one option and other random names are put in other options , on choosing any option the user is told whether they 
were correct or not and a new image and new options are given , repeating the process.
